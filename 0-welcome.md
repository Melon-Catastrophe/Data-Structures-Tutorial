Kyler Mellor, CSE 212-01, mel17006@byui.edu

Welcome to my Data Structures Tutorial! We will be learning about a few different data structures, including:

- [Queues](1-queue.md)
- [Sets](2-set.md)
- [Trees](3-tree.md)

We will be using examples in Python to demonstrate the different data structures. Please ensure that you have Python and a compatible IDE installed to be able to get the most out of this tutorial.
